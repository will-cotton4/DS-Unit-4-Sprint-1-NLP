    "As we learned yesterday, machines cannot intrepret raw text. We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text data to prepare it for maching learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a dataframe and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n",

      "b'Mobiles rack up 20 years of use\\n\\nMobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.\\n\\nBritain\\'s first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.\\n\\nThe first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine\\'s dock to Vodafone\\'s head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about \\xc2\\xa32,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.\\n\\n\"Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,\" he said. \"They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.\" This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. \"It\\'s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,\" he said. \"Cellnet was forecasting half that.\" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.\\n'\n"

    "\n",
    "To address the computational inefficiencies of the brute-force approach, a variety of tree-based data structures have been invented. In general, these structures attempt to reduce the required number of distance calculations by efficiently encoding aggregate distance information for the sample. The basic idea is that if point  is very distant from point , and point  is very close to point , then we know that points  and  are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance. In this way, the computational cost of a nearest neighbors search can be reduced to  or better. This is a significant improvement over brute-force for large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the inefficiencies of KD Trees in higher dimensions, the ball tree data structure was developed. Where KD trees partition data along Cartesian axes, ball trees partition data in a series of nesting hyper-spheres. This makes tree construction more costly than that of the KD tree, but results in a data structure which can be very efficient on highly structured data, even in very high dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ball tree recursively divides the data into nodes defined by a centroid  and radius , such that each point in the node lies within the hyper-sphere defined by  and . The number of candidate points for a neighbor search is reduced through use of the triangle inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, a single distance calculation between a test point and the centroid is sufficient to determine a lower and upper bound on the distance to all points within the node. Because of the spherical geometry of the ball tree nodes, it can out-perform a KD-tree in high dimensions, though the actual performance is highly dependent on the structure of the training data. In scikit-learn, ball-tree-based neighbors searches are specified using the keyword algorithm = 'ball_tree', and are computed using the class sklearn.neighbors.BallTree. Alternatively, the user can work with the BallTree class directly."

       "b'Technology gets the creative bug\\n\\nThe hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.\\n\\nOften this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. And vice versa. UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative. The idea, says BT, is to shape a \"21st Century model\" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together. \"We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology,\" said Frank Stone, head of the BT\\'s business sector programmes. He looks after several \"centres of excellence\" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations, one of which is focused on creative industries.\\n\\nTo mark the initiative\\'s launch, a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels, with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. They have both been created using the telco\\'s technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. Using a 3D graphics engine, the type commonly used in gaming, Bafta-winning artists Langlands & Bell have created a virtual, story-based, 3D model of Brussels\\' Coudenberg Cellars.\\n\\nThey have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of Coudenberg Palace, an historical seat of European power. The 3D world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th Century. \"The river was integral to the city\\'s survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared,\" said the artists. \"We hope that by uncovering the river, we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present, and appreciate the flow of modernity, once concealing, but now revealing the River Senne.\" In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine. The game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering, game AI, and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. They are so time-consuming and expensive to create, the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. BT\\'s own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. It was also used in 2003 in Encounter, an urban-based, pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical, on-the-street action. Because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds, new features were added to Tara in order to handle the complex data sets. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.\\n\\nAs more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology. The Orange Expressionist exhibition last year, for example, displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the UK to create an interactive installation.\\n\\nTechnology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential, not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. Big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. The art world is \"fantastically rich\", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them. Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought \\xc2\\xa321 billion to London alone. It is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Mr Stone. \"This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online,\" he said. \"It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem.\" With broadband penetration reaching 100% in the UK, businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. The creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies. \"What we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. \"We are creating a future cultural drive for the economy,\" said Mr Stone.\\n'"

    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of Bag-of-Words approaches is that any information about the textual context surrounding that word is lost. This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n",
    "Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n",

    "### Word2Vec Intuition\n",
    "### The Distribution Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the Distribution Hypothesis (Reference: Distribution Hypothesis Theory  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics. The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n",

    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n",

Word2Vec can consider a larger context than only words that are immediately to the left and right of a given word, but we're going to keep our window of context small for this example.

    "#### Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text:**\n",
    "**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n",
    "\n",
    "*Training Sample with window of 2*: (the, speedy), (the, Porsche)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text:**\n",
    "The\t**speedy**\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n",

    "\n",
    "*Training Sample with window of 2*: (drove, speedy), (drove, Porsche), (drove, past), (drove, the)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Continuous Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Proshe”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical depiction of the input to output prediction pipeline for both variants of the Word2vec model is attached. The graphical depiction will help crystallize the difference between SkipGrams and Continuous Bag of Words.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Notable Differences between Word Embedding methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) W2V focuses less document topic-modeling. You'll notice that the vectorizations don't really retain much information about the original document that the information came from. At least not in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) W2V can result in really large and complex vectorizations. In fact, you need Deep Neural Networks to train your Word2Vec models from scratch, but we can use helpful pretrained embeddings (thank you Google) to do really cool things!\n",
